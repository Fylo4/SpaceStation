It opens with their most famous song, Carry On Wayward Son. The rest of the songs here aren't as famous, but are equally great rock songs with great lyrics and instrumental sections. Some other great Kansas albums are Point of Know Return, Song for America, and Masque. "),t()(),e(15,"h2"),a(16,"2.

This album is very unique and makes creative decisions that make it sound unlike any other album. It radiates confidence, sexuality, and love. It's groovy, with a strong beat, very catchy songs, and great transitions. If this doesn't make you want to dance, I don't know what will. "),t()(),e(21,"h2"),a(22,"3.

Even if you don't care about videogames, you will still appreciate the beautiful, grand orchestral tracks. It is particularly valuable to me because I grew up playing this game when I was about 7 years old. Whether you're a Nintendo fan or just love classical orchestral music, you will love this album.

Kirtan Wallah - Krishna Das (2014)"),t(),e(29,"div",2),n(30,"img",6),e(31,"p"),a(32,` Kirtan is Hindu devotional chanting, and Wallah is someone who performs an action, so Kirtan Wallah basically means "someone who sings kirtan". I enjoy kirtan music a lot, and this is my favorite album in the genre I've found. The instruments and singing is beautiful, and it gets even more beautiful as you learn the meaning and symbolism behind each of the chants. Radhe Govinda, for instance, refers to Krishna, the embodiment of the godhead (also called Govinda), and Radha, who is Krishna's love and an embodiment of that love, so when I sing "Radhe Govinda", I'm singing "My love of God, God's love for us". `),t()(),e(33,"h2"),a(34,"5.

According to Wikipedia, Mort Garson origninally wrote this for his house plants and handed out to customers of a plant store called Mother Earth, or who bought a Simmons mattress from Sears (no clue what the link to mattresses is). If you want to chill with some fun music looping in the background, try this album. "),t()(),e(39,"h2"),a(40,"6.

I enjoy this one in particular because it has seemless transitions, making the whole album sound like one cohesive song. It has samples of Terence McKenna (to whom the album is dedicated) and my favorite movie Waking Life. Apparently it also follows 8 phases of a dream sequence. All of Shpongle's music can turn your brain into a pretzel (especially with some botanical help). If you're into psychedelic culture and haven't listened to Shpongle, do yourself a favor and put this on.
