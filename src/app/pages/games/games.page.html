                    Absurd 8's Variant Deck
                </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                <p>
                    I designed a deck of playing cards, based on crazy 8's, where each card also has a unique Uno-like rule.
                    It's an interesting concept. I haven't constructed and tested the latest version yet.
                    You will have to make your own deck for this- I'd recommend getting blank poker cards and sharpies.
                    It can get pretty complex / technical, so if you don't like that, skip this one.

                    Super Rummy Variant Deck
                </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                <p>
                    I designed a deck of playing cards, based on Rummy. Many (but not all) cards have printed rules on them.
                    It is basically like Rummy DLC. It's more strategic than Absurd 8's and pretty fun.
                    I do have a print-and-play available- it printed the front and back sides together, but the back is blank,
                    so you probably just want to print the odd pages (I don't feel like removing the blank pages).
                    I also have the json export from <a href="https://oatear.github.io/cider/">cider</a> if you want to edit it.
