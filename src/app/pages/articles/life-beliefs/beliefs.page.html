<p>
    This list of my core beliefs is the culmination of my spirital seeking from my late teens / early 20's,
    and informs my mission statement. It is therefore the foundational bedrock of my life system.
    I am not trying to convince you of anything here. I'm not evangelizing, just offering up these ideas
    in case you're interested. As always, feel free to leave your own ideas in the comments.

<!-- #region 1. Unity -->
<h2>1. Everything is essentially one</h2>
<p>
    We percieve the world as several separate objects. I am separate from you and the rest of the world,
    the bee is separate from the hive and the flowers, this is separate from that. My claim here is that
    this apparent separation is not a true representation of the world. Although the bee, flower, and hive
    are somewhat distinct, their difference is like the difference between two waves in the same ocean.
    You can point to the boundary of each wave, just as you can point to the outline of the bee and the outline
    of the hive. But both waves are manifestations of the same underlying ocean, and all bees, hives, and
    flowers are manifestations of the same system. Bee colonies act very similarly to different cells in our
    bodies. Different bees perform different roles, which all come together for the collective survival of
    the entire hive. The entire hive is therefore a superorganism with just as much existential validity
    as you or me. In much the same way, all hives, all pollen-producing plants, all other pollenators and
    insects forms a cohesive system. The entire global biosphere is a cohesive system, one giant superorganism.
    We and all other creatures are facets of that superorganism. We could likewise point out the borders between
    our individual organs, or individual cells, or even atoms, and call them separate objects. Wherever we decide
    to draw the line between separate objects, that line is arbitrary and exists only in our head. There
    are no dividing lines in the real world, and thus no separate objects, apart from us inventing them.
</p>
<p>
    I don't believe our material bodies are truly separate. We continuously take in food, water, air, 
    sense data, etc., and we are continuously outputting matter and energy. We are not a closed system.
    The matter that makes you up changes all the time. As Alan Watts says, we are like whirlpools in water-
    you can see a persistant pattern, but the water that makes it up is always changing. So we have no material
    bodies which are separate from the rest of the world, they are just material manifestations of the world.
</p>
<p>
    The same is true with patterns and movement. What controls celestial bodies, rivers flowing, and trees growing?
    The laws of physics (or, rather, the underlying patterns which laws of physics are attempting to describe).
    The same underlying laws of physics control all of these movements and patterns. The same is true about us.
    Our brains, which determine our actions, perception, and thoughts, are similarly controlled by the laws of
    physics. In other words, that which controls me also controls you, and the rest of the universe. So there is
    no separate, distinct thing which I can call "my mind".
</p>
<p>
    I believe the same is true about consciousness. I'm not really sure how consciousness works (I don't think
    any reputable person is sure about this). But if I had to guess, I would say that each of our individual
    points of consciousness are just manifestations of the greater underlying cosmic consciousness, in much the
    same way that our minds are manifestations of the laws of physics, and our bodies are manifestations of
    the material world. Perhaps it is some sort of field, like the electromagnetic field. Our bodies are like circuits,
    our minds are like the logic the circuits are running, and our individual consciousnesses are like the
    electromagnetic effects which the circuits produce. It appears to produce its own electromagnetic field,
    but there is really only one electromagnetic field which spans the entire universe. This metaphor might
    be wrong, but I think the idea that all our consciousnesses are aspects of an underlying system is probably right.
</p>
<p>
    This idea has many consequences. I don't think we have free will (in the libertarian sense; compatabilism
    may be true in some way). I also don't think we stop existing when we die; our bodies stop working, but
    our underlying essence- the entire universe- continues, and we continue on through that process. One large
    consequence is that we are in unity with everything good in this universe, and everything bad as well.
    Infinite bliss and infinite suffering. This confrontation is addressed in belief 2:

<!-- #region 2. Acceptance -->
<h2>2. Rejection or Acceptance</h2>
<p>
    So, the entire universe is one, and we are one with the whole thing. We can choose to respond to that
    in two ways: rejection or acceptance.
</p>
<p>
    Rejection is being against the world, or posturing yourself in opposition to the totality of the universe.
    There are legitimate reasons to take this posture. The world is full of both conscious suffering and
    moral evil. It can feel meaningless, resulting in a nihilistic loathing for existence. You may be depressed
    and just want it to end. After realizing that all is one, you could be filled with cosmic loneliness-
    I am the only thing that exists, omnipresent and omnilonely. For any of these reasons (or some other reason
    I have not thought of), you might view the universe, and God if you believe in that, as something that
    ought not exist.
</p>
<p>
    If you are in this camp, it may comfort you to know that you aren't the first person to experience this.
    You absolutely can move through it into a posture of acceptance. I am proof of this.
</p>
<p>
    The other response is acceptance. This is looking at the whole universe, the good and the bad, and choosing
    to say "it is well with my soul". It is not pretending that the bad does not exist or trying to ignore it.
    You must be able to fully embrace the evil within yourself and the world, which is no small feat. If you can
    do this, then you will find that there are even more reasons to love the world. You will be able to find
    beauty in everything. Joy and sorrow are both beautiful, and life is worth living until the last second.
</p>
<p>
    If I could freely choose one or the other, rejection or acceptance, I think the decision is obvious.
</p>

<!-- #region 3. Love -->
<h2>3. Love</h2>
<p>
    Once you have experienced the unity of everything and have accepted it, the obvious implication is that
    you ought to love everything in it. If you truly enbrace the universe, or God, the source of the universe,
    then you ought to love everything in it. You see the beauty in the galaxies and landscapes. More importantly,
    you love consciousness itself, and each of the creatures through which consciousness is expressed.
</p>
<p>
    Love can be used in several different ways. It could be a momentary feeling - a flutter in your chest. It could
    express a preference or something you enjoy: "I love ice cream". A deeper meaning is devotion or care for
    someone even when you don't feel it or have that preference: "I love you even though you are making me mad".
    Unlike the first two, you have to choose to have this love every day. Words are cheap, but this type of love
    is expressed through action. When Jesus was asked what it means to love your neighbor, he gave the story of the
    good samaritan. Love means taking care of someone, figuring out what they need and doing everything in your
    power to make sure they get it.
</p>
<p>
    I believe that the call to compassionately love everyone necessarily follows from the first two beliefs.
</p>
<!-- #endregion -->

<h2>4. The Three Virtues</h2>
<p>
    The obvious next question is, how should we love each other? We already have compassionate love, but how
    should we live our lives in order to maximize the expression of this love? What types of action follow
    from the first three beliefs? I believe that it essentially boils down to three virtues: wisdom, 
    strength, and presence.
</p>
<p>
    Wisdom is essentially our navigation system. It points us to where we want to go and tells us what actions
    will take us closer or further from it. Thinking about the stuff on this page, and on my Life Systems page,
    have been good sources of wisdom for me (and I hope they give you some, too). Contemplation, reading good
    books, and direct life experience can all produce wisdom.
</p>
<p>
    Once you know what you should do, strength or discipline is getting it done. This is the engine.
    It requires grit and perseverance to do anything worth doing. I'm not entirely sure how to develop
    this type of strength, but I currently conceptualize it as a muscle, which can be trained by
    repeatedly doing the hard stuff. Every time you do something hard, you're putting in reps.
    There is also a degree of developing strength in different disciplines as well- being able to lift
    heavy things, run fast, focus, think quickly, developing skills so you have the physical ability to
    do stuff. This of course should be guided by compassion and wisdom.
</p>
<p>
    Presence is being in the moment, undistracted. In life we are constantly tempted to fall into a type
    of sleep, to lose awareness of the big picture. Presence fights against this, allowing us to stay
    in the moment, remembering what is actually important. Presence is also the appreciation of the
    current moment. It is easy to miss the beauty of the moment, like the child who mindlessly eats an
    ice cream cone and only notices when it is all gone. Presence is the refusal to be distracted by
    thoughts of the past or the future, and refusal to numb one's mind through passive consumption.
</p>
<p>
    These are broadly the three virtues that I try to live in my day-to-day life. You could get into the
    specifics of sub-virtues (e.g. strength -> courage, resiliance, self-control, ...) or come up with
    a different list. I just try to keep it simple so it is easy to remember. Wisdom, strength, and
    presence- good mind, good body, good soul.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    So that's my belief system. I try to keep it epistemologically light. Only four points- unity,
    acceptance, love, and virtue. It used to be a lot longer and more complex, but I've whittled it
    down into the most essential and justifiable form. I believe everything is straightforward and
    can be logically supported. I also think it is compatable with pretty much any religion, philosophy,
    and political belief (at least I don't know of one that this is incompatable with).
