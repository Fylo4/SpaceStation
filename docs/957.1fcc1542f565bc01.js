If you care about what Jesus has to say in the synoptic gospels, then this passage must be of primary importance.

Hear, O Israel: The Lord your God is One"),e.k0s(),e.j41(47,"p"),e.EFF(48,' This quote from Deuteronomy 6, known as the Shema, points to the oneness of God. Although many people interpret this as merely saying that God is the only deity, many people in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic history have used this verse to support the idea that there is nothing outside of or apart from God. It is related to Deut. 4:35: "there is none besides Him [God]". The Shahada, foundational to the beliefs of Muslims, states "There is no god but God". To me, and to many mystics, Kabbalists, Hasidic Jews, and Sufis throughout history, this points to the oneness and unity of everything in the universe, and unity with God. Further, in John 17:20-23, Jesus prays that we all be one, and one with the Father, just as Jesus himself is one with the Father, that He loves us just as he loves Jesus. "Hear, O Israel, The Lord your God is One" then becomes a wake-up call, inviting us into that unity. Remember, we are all one!\n'),e.k0s(),e.j41(49,"h2"),e.EFF(50,"2.

Jesus claims that we can take part in a relationship with God, a loving relationship described as heaven. We can essentially take two attitudes towards God, either acceptance or rejection. If we accept and love God, and foster this loving relationship, then our actions will work in accordance with God. If we hate God, reject His creation, and become an enemy of the divine, then there is no saving us. If hell is separation from God, then this is a guaranteed path to hell.

For us humans, our art is often imperfect. It would be justifiable to love someone and not love their creation because our creations aren't a reflection of our nature. Unlike humans, though, God does not make mistakes, and God's nature is present in creation. So it is impossible to love God and not love creation. Humans in particular, according to Genesis, have God's very breath in us and were made in God's image. The majority of what Jesus talks about in the synoptic gospels is how to treat other people well. We are told to do unto others what we would have done to us, to take care of the orphans, widows, and immigrants, to feed the hungry, heal the sick, clothe the poor. Jesus always talks about loving our neighbor not just as a fuzzy feeling in our chest, but as action. In fact, in Luke, right after giving the greatest commandments, he is asked what it means to love our neighbor. He responds with the parable of the good samaritan.

Of course, this is not permission to be selfish and prioritize your own gain at the expense of others. Neither is it a permission for excessive, decadent "self-care", which only serves our vanity and ego while distracting us from what is really important. If loving yourself gets in the way of loving your neighbor, or vice versa, then this is a problem. Like loving others, our love for ourself should be an active love that seeks to improve our lives and wellbeing. You should be a friend to yourself.
