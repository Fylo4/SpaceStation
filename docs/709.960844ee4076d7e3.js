I enjoy kirtan music a lot, and this is my favorite album in the genre I\'ve found. The instruments and singing is beautiful, and it gets even more beautiful as you learn the meaning and symbolism behind each of the chants. Radhe Govinda, for instance, refers to Krishna, the embodiment of the godhead (also called Govinda), and Radha, who is Krishna\'s love and an embodiment of that love, so when I sing "Radhe Govinda", I\'m singing "My love of God, God\'s love for us".

It has samples of Terence McKenna (to whom the album is dedicated) and my favorite movie Waking Life. Apparently it also follows 8 phases of a dream sequence. All of Shpongle's music can turn your brain into a pretzel (especially with some botanical help).
