If you care about what Jesus has to say in the synoptic gospels, then this passage must be of primary importance. I like all three of these versions for different reasons, but for the sake of this article I will consider the Mark version. I break this down into six sections:
`),t(),e(45,"h2"),n(46,"1. Hear, O Israel: The Lord your God is One"),t(),e(47,"p"),n(48,` This quote from Deuteronomy 6, known as the Shema, points to the oneness of God. Although many people interpret this as merely saying that God is the only deity, many people in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic history have used this verse to support the idea that there is nothing outside of or apart from God. It is related to Deut. 4:35: "there is none besides Him [God]". The Shahada, foundational to the beliefs of Muslims, states "There is no god but God". To me, and to many mystics, Kabbalists, Hasidic Jews, and Sufis throughout history, this points to the oneness and unity of everything in the universe, and unity with God. Further, in John 17:20-23, Jesus prays that we all be one, and one with the Father, just as Jesus himself is one with the Father, that He loves us just as he loves Jesus. "Hear, O Israel, The Lord your God is One" then becomes a wake-up call, inviting us into that unity. Remember, we are all one!
`),t(),e(49,"h2"),n(50,"2. Love the Lord your God"),t(),e(51,"p"),n(52,` Here we are being told to love the ultimate, the transcendent, the divine. Jesus claims that we can take part in a relationship with God, a loving relationship described as heaven. We can essentially take two attitudes towards God, either acceptance or rejection. If we accept and love God, and foster this loving relationship, then our actions will work in accordance with God. If we hate God, reject His creation, and become an enemy of the divine, then there is no saving us. If hell is separation from God, then this is a guaranteed path to hell. Since God is the creator and sustainer of the entire universe, loving God also means reconciling yourself with the universe, and loving it too.
`),t(),e(53,"h2"),n(54,"3. With all your heart, soul, mind, and strength"),t(),e(55,"p"),n(56,` The love that we are to have for God should be all-consuming. We must love with every fiber of our being, and everything we have. Love should take up all of us. With our heart, we must be compassionate. With our soul, we must be present and righteous. With our mind, we must be wise and intelligent. With our strength, we must take action, especially difficult action, in accordance with love.
`),t(),e(57,"h2"),n(58,"4. Love your neighbor"),t(),e(59,"p"),n(60,` Presumably also with all our heart, soul mind, and strength. God created everything, and everything is an expression of God. For us humans, our art is often imperfect. It would be justifiable to love someone and not love their creation because our creations aren't a reflection of our nature. Unlike humans, though, God does not make mistakes, and God's nature is present in creation. So it is impossible to love God and not love creation. Humans in particular, according to Genesis, have God's very breath in us and were made in God's image. The majority of what Jesus talks about in the synoptic gospels is how to treat other people well. We are told to do unto others what we would have done to us, to take care of the orphans, widows, and immigrants, to feed the hungry, heal the sick, clothe the poor. Jesus always talks about loving our neighbor not just as a fuzzy feeling in our chest, but as action. In fact, in Luke, right after giving the greatest commandments, he is asked what it means to love our neighbor. He responds with the parable of the good samaritan. Loving each other means having compassion, taking care of each other, making sure we are well.
`),t(),e(61,"h2"),n(62,"5. As yourself"),t(),e(63,"p"),n(64,` Don't forget, we are also a creation of God! Loving humans also means loving yourself. Of course, this is not permission to be selfish and prioritize your own gain at the expense of others. Neither is it a permission for excessive, decadent "self-care", which only serves our vanity and ego while distracting us from what is really important. If loving yourself gets in the way of loving your neighbor, or vice versa, then this is a problem. Like loving others, our love for ourself should be an active love that seeks to improve our lives and wellbeing. You should be a friend to yourself. Just like with others, you should give yourself compassion and forgiveness.
`),t(),e(65,"h2"),n(66,"6. There is no other commandment greater than these"),t(),e(67,"p"),n(68,` Or, as Matthew says, "On these two commandments hang all the laws and the prophets". I believe this gives us permission to interpret other verses of the bible in light of these greatest commandments. If anything else in the bible contradicts the commands to love God and love your neighbor, then this takes greater precedence. There is no greater commandment, and the entire old testament (the laws and prophets) rely on this. If you fulfil the commandment to love, then you are also fulfilling the entire law.
