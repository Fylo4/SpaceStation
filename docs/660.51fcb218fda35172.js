I am separate from you and the rest of the world, the bee is separate from the hive and the flowers, this is separate from that. My claim here is that this apparent separation is not a true representation of the world. Although the bee, flower, and hive are somewhat distinct, their difference is like the difference between two waves in the same ocean. You can point to the boundary of each wave, just as you can point to the outline of the bee and the outline of the hive. But both waves are manifestations of the same underlying ocean, and all bees, hives, and flowers are manifestations of the same system. Bee colonies act very similarly to different cells in our bodies. Different bees perform different roles, which all come together for the collective survival of the entire hive. The entire hive is therefore a superorganism with just as much existential validity as you or me. In much the same way, all hives, all pollen-producing plants, all other pollenators and insects forms a cohesive system. The entire global biosphere is a cohesive system, one giant superorganism. We and all other creatures are facets of that superorganism. We could likewise point out the borders between our individual organs, or individual cells, or even atoms, and call them separate objects. Wherever we decide to draw the line between separate objects, that line is arbitrary and exists only in our head. There are no dividing lines in the real world, and thus no separate objects, apart from us inventing them.\n"),e.k0s(),e.j41(17,"p"),e.EFF(18," I don't believe our material bodies are truly separate. We continuously take in food, water, air, sense data, etc., and we are continuously outputting matter and energy. We are not a closed system. The matter that makes you up changes all the time. As Alan Watts says, we are like whirlpools in water- you can see a persistant pattern, but the water that makes it up is always changing. So we have no material bodies which are separate from the rest of the world, they are just material manifestations of the world.\n"),e.k0s(),e.j41(19,"p"),e.EFF(20,' The same is true with patterns and movement. What controls celestial bodies, rivers flowing, and trees growing? The laws of physics (or, rather, the underlying patterns which laws of physics are attempting to describe). The same underlying laws of physics control all of these movements and patterns. The same is true about us. Our brains, which determine our actions, perception, and thoughts, are similarly controlled by the laws of physics.

I'm not really sure how consciousness works (I don't think any reputable person is sure about this). But if I had to guess, I would say that each of our individual points of consciousness are just manifestations of the greater underlying cosmic consciousness, in much the same way that our minds are manifestations of the laws of physics, and our bodies are manifestations of the material world. Perhaps it is some sort of field, like the electromagnetic field. Our bodies are like circuits, our minds are like the logic the circuits are running, and our individual consciousnesses are like the electromagnetic effects which the circuits produce. It appears to produce its own electromagnetic field, but there is really only one electromagnetic field which spans the entire universe.

There are legitimate reasons to take this posture. The world is full of both conscious suffering and moral evil. It can feel meaningless, resulting in a nihilistic loathing for existence. You may be depressed and just want it to end. After realizing that all is one, you could be filled with cosmic loneliness- I am the only thing that exists, omnipresent and omnilonely.

This is looking at the whole universe, the good and the bad, and choosing to say "it is well with my soul". It is not pretending that the bad does not exist or trying to ignore it. You must be able to fully embrace the evil within yourself and the world, which is no small feat. If you can do this, then you will find that there are even more reasons to love the world.

It could be a momentary feeling - a flutter in your chest. It could express a preference or something you enjoy: "I love ice cream". A deeper meaning is devotion or care for someone even when you don\'t feel it or have that preference: "I love you even though you are making me mad". Unlike the first two, you have to choose to have this love every day. Words are cheap, but this type of love is expressed through action.

This is the engine. It requires grit and perseverance to do anything worth doing. I'm not entirely sure how to develop this type of strength, but I currently conceptualize it as a muscle, which can be trained by repeatedly doing the hard stuff. Every time you do something hard, you're putting in reps. There is also a degree of developing strength in different disciplines as well- being able to lift heavy things, run fast, focus, think quickly, developing skills so you have the physical ability to do stuff. This of course should be guided by compassion and wisdom.\n"),e.k0s(),e.j41(53,"p"),e.EFF(54," Presence is being in the moment, undistracted. In life we are constantly tempted to fall into a type of sleep, to lose awareness of the big picture. Presence fights against this, allowing us to stay in the moment, remembering what is actually important. Presence is also the appreciation of the current moment. It is easy to miss the beauty of the moment, like the child who mindlessly eats an ice cream cone and only notices when it is all gone.
