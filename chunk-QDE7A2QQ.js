The goal is to optimize the health and wellbeing of the entire organism, and mobilize the system's resources to accomplish whatever goals we find most important. Each of these systems can be broken down into subsystems and so on depending on what level of detail is most useful. Reaching our goals require both improving each system, and improving how the system aligns with our overall goals. "),t(),i(11,"p"),e(12,` I use the term "system" here because each of these areas of life have inputs, outputs, resource flows, and processes. It is similar to a car, which is a complex system with several subsystems- powertrain, steering, suspension, etc. Each subsystem has several parts to it, which themselves are smaller systems. When one part isn't serving the goals of the entire car (or driver), it is repaired or replaced. For each area in life, you are also a single node in a much larger community, national, or global system; for instance, your personal finance system is a single node in the global economic system, and your social network is one part of your community's social network. This is further reason to improve aspects of your life. Not only will it help you reach your goals and improve your personal health, it will also help other people who are connected to the same networks as you.
`),t(),i(13,"p"),e(14,` Another useful framing of this is "areas of health" instead of "system". This article is talking about your physical, mental, spiritual, social, financial, etc. health. You can imagine you're in a video game, and your character has several health bars, each of which need to be managed. I will continue to conceptualize this as interlocking systems though.
`),t(),i(15,"p"),e(16,` This was loosely inspired by the Wheel of Life exercise. That exercise asks you to look at 8 particular areas in your life and rate them from 1-10, then describe what your life would look like if you were at a 10 in each of them. Or something like that, I've never actually done the exercise. Something similar could definitely be done here- look at each category and rate your health, and envision what lifestyle you would have at a 10.
`),t(),i(17,"p"),e(18,` I believe reaching a 10 in each area would be implausible; it would take way more than 24 hours each day and way more resources than most people have. But I personally don't think I need all areas to be maxed out. I think several of them can be around 7-8, healthy enough they don't cause problems, but not consume too many resources. Perhaps you should aim for one or two of them to be 10's. Then the operative question is, what score do I want in each area, what would that level look like, and what resources and actions would be necessary for this?
`),t(),i(19,"p"),e(20,` There are several principles I am looking for in each system:
`),t(),i(21,"ul")(22,"li")(23,"b"),e(24,"Intentionality"),t(),e(25," - If you don't intentionally plan stuff out and think about stuff, then you will do stuff based on whims and dopamine circuits. This is prime real estate for corporations, advertisers, political entities, etc. to take advantage of you, and manipulate your actions to benefit themselves. If you think through everything systematically, then you will be better able to transform your life into and achieve what you want. "),t(),i(26,"li")(27,"b"),e(28,"Cognitive Offloading"),t(),e(29," - You don't want to spend a lot of effort making decisions each day. We have finite cognitive resources; using those resources on mundane tasks that can be offloaded results in more stress and worse decisions. As you automate decisions and organize systems in helpful ways, you will automatically know what needs to be done. Offloading can also reduce feelings of stress or guilt. Mechanisms for offloading include reminders, lists, and better organization systems. "),t(),i(30,"li")(31,"b"),e(32,"Compound growth"),t(),e(33," - If you can make something improve at an exponential rate, do it. The most well-known example is finances, where the amount of returns you get from investments is proportional to the amount you have invested. Friendships, communities, learning, and many other areas can follow similar patterns, where the longer you let it grow, the larger and faster it can grow. Having long time horizons (being able to wait a long time for success) really helps here. "),t(),i(34,"li")(35,"b"),e(36,"Diversity"),t(),e(37," - The health of a system is often tied to its diversity. For instance, biodiversity is a very strong indicator for the health of an environment. This can be a type of compounding. Gaining a diversity of skills that build on each other is better than mastering a single skill. Gaining diverse friends or consuming diverse ideas greatly improves your social and intellectual lives. "),t(),i(38,"li")(39,"b"),e(40,"Automation"),t(),e(41," - Many of these systems can be automated, or only require one-time improvements. This is ideal so we don't have to continually invest resources (time, energy) into an area, but can still collect the benefits. For instance, in your financial system, you can create automatic deposits, card payments, and investments, so you don't even have to think about anything when you get paid. "),t(),i(42,"li")(43,"b"),e(44,"Stacking"),t(),e(45," - Doing something that accomplishes two things at once make you twice as productive. Running with my dog gives me exercise and is treating my dog well. Sports with friends hits social and physical health. This is not to be confused with multitasking, which usually results in doing 2 things very poorly, and often involves a lot of context switching. "),t()(),i(46,"p"),e(47,` Enough yapping, let's see the list already!
`),t(),n(48,"hr"),i(49,"h2"),e(50,"Purpose / Meaning / Goals"),t(),i(51,"p"),e(52,` This isn't really a system, but I put it here first because it should be your north star or guiding principle. Finding purpose or meaning in your life, coming up with an overarching life goal and intermediate goals to reach it, can help you determine how you want to manage all other systems.
`),t(),i(53,"p"),e(54,` What is your guiding principle? If you could do anything, be anyone, what would you want to do and who would you want to be? There are many valid answers to this question. Some examples of good guiding goals include personal happiness and wellbeing, wellbeing for your family, artistic self-expression, science and knowlede, or spiritual / religious attainment. Beneath the overarching principle could be a large goal for how you want to achieve it. This can help you create a mission statement.
`),t(),i(55,"p"),e(56,` My personal mission statement is, "To improve the lives of people around me, especially the most marginalized or in-need, through compassion, giving, and community-level mutual aid systems".
`),t(),i(57,"p"),e(58,` Having a mission statment like that can allow you to more deeply analyze what is most important and how to get there. After contemplating about how I can improve the lives of others, I came up with this list: Ways of Doing Good. The health of this purpose / meaning / goals system is directly proportional to how well I am following that list. Regularly examining how your life aligns with your mission will ensure you're making the most of your time and effort.
`),t(),n(59,"hr"),i(60,"h2"),e(61,"Time system"),t(),i(62,"p"),e(63,` An organism's time system is probably their most important system to manage well. How you spend your time dictates what areas of your life improve or worsen. By default, we do not deliberately think about this, and how we manage our time is based on whims and outside influences.
`),t(),i(64,"p"),e(65,` It is probably too extreme to overhaul your entire life and the way you spend your time in one go. This could result in burnout or giving up. It may be better to gradually introduce a couple rules at a time. At first, this may be regulating when you sleep and work, then progressively regulate more tasks or blocks of time. A mature time management system would automate time-related decisions, so if you just follow the system you are guaranteed to get your stuff done and improve in several key areas of life, spending your time in a way that aligns with your core values.
`),t(),i(66,"p"),e(67,` If you're building your time system, it may be a good idea to schedule a weekly or monthly evaluation of the entire system, so not only are individual areas of your life improving, the system by which you manage these areas is also improving.
`),t(),i(68,"p"),e(69,` Some tools I use to help manage time:
`),t(),i(70,"ul")(71,"li"),e(72," Calendar - I used to use this to block off repeated tasks so I can see what I'm doing when on each day.

Your family, relationships with individual friends, friend groups, communities, and romantic relationships are all their own systems. The health of your family might be much different than the health of your church or club community, for instance.
`),t(),i(88,"p"),e(89,` In general, I believe that having good social connections is one of the most important factors for your overall wellbeing. I think of it as four areas- family, friends, communities, and romance / partnership. I personally have no interest in the romance / partnership aspect but the other three are very important to me. There are many options for community connections - neighborhood, work, school, church, hobbies, sports, clubs, even being a regular at a restaurant or bar.
`),t(),i(90,"p"),e(91,` Keeping track of each person or group, the health of that relationship, and the last time you did something with them can help visualize and proritize. Figuring out a target level of interaction with that person or group would also be useful - e.g. I want to call each of these friends once a month, hang out with this group every other week, and spend quality time with my parents / siblings once a week. Having that conversation with the people involved could also be a powerful way to make sure everyone's on the same page about how you want to spend time together, and how much. (Deciding how you want to relate with other people is a key concept in relationship anarchy- I recommend you check it out if you haven't heard of it before)
`),t(),n(92,"hr"),i(93,"h2"),e(94,"Physical health"),t(),i(95,"p"),e(96,` The body is essentially a mechanical system. It has input requirements (e.g. food, water), maintenance requirements (e.g. health checkups, repairs), and usage requirements (e.g. movement / exercise, sleep). It is also the vehicle by which you are able to operate in your life. If you have physical health problems, it will reduce your resources and cause strain to all other areas of health. This quote is attributed to Abraham Lincoln: "Give me 6 hours to chop down a tree and I would spend the first 4 hours sharpening my axe". Improving your body is one way to sharpen the axe and improve your ability in all other areas.
`),t(),i(97,"p"),e(98,` Everyone has their own list of "the X pillars of physical health". As far as I'm concerned, there are really four that will have the largest results: diet, exercise, sleep, and risk prevention.
`),t(),i(99,"p")(100,"b"),e(101,"Diet"),t(),e(102,` - Plan weight, calory, and macronutrient goals. Meal planning / prepping / tracking takes more effort but can take your dietary system to a higher level. There are other levers you can pull like intermittent fasting or dietary restrictions.

"),t(),i(107,"p")(108,"b"),e(109,"Sleep"),t(),e(110,` - Improve the sleep environment (temperature, light, noise, comfort), what you do before bed (limits to caffeine or technology, nighttime routine), and get into a regular sleep routine with little to no variation in sleep or wakeup times.
`),t(),i(111,"p")(112,"b"),e(113,"Risk prevention"),t(),e(114,` - See below "Safety / Emergencies" section
`),t(),i(115,"p"),e(116,` Obviously there are other areas of physical health I haven't mentioned, and any of these areas could have entire books written about them. I'm not an expert so you probably want to do a lot of further research.

Obviously your health in any other area will affect this. Exercising improves mood, having bad finances increases stress, etc. Apart improving these other systems, there are several things that I find helpful: spending time in nature; destressing and destimulating; processing emotions through journaling, self-expression, and therapy.
`),t(),i(122,"p"),e(123,` One interesting idea relating to this is that a human isn't a single distinct and unchanging self, but are rather composed of several distinct selves, with their own goals, behaviors, and preferences. The book "Your Symphony of Selves" by James Fadiman and Jordan Gruber argues that everybody is a multiplicity of selves. The internal family systems therapy model has similar claims. One imporant feature of mental health, then, is recognizing what each part of you wants and harmonizing with yourself. This can address self-sabotoge or self-hatred and make sure that 100% of you is happy with your life.
`),t(),i(124,"p"),e(125,` I feel like a lot of discussion about mental health in the current culture is centered on therapy, emotional regulation, trauma, stuff like that. Not as many people are talking about learning, puzzles, reading and other intake of information, that sort of stuff. Just like the body, the mind needs exercise to stay sharp. I have heard books described as "mental calisthenics" and "reading is conversing with ancient geniuses". Learning new skills also seems great for mental health and personal development. I've also heard that spending time with your own thoughts, whether through journaling or walking in solitude or any other way, is good mental exercise. As I research more into the mental health system, I'll try to build something that takes care of both the "therapy"-ish stuff and the "crosswords"-ish stuff.
`),t(),n(126,"hr"),i(127,"h2"),e(128,"Spirituality / Religion"),t(),i(129,"p"),e(130,` This is one component that I don't think everyone has to have. It is similar to romantic relationships in that way. Religious groups often provide community, practices for personal growth, wisdom texts, community service opportunities, and many other benefits. But connecting with the divine, whatever you believe that to be, seems to have benefits that go beyond the effects of organized religion. This can include feelings such as peace, awe, gratitude, or love, feeling that one is connected with the whole universe, a sense of deep purpose in your life. If you decide spirituality and religion belong in your life, it is worth planning out what events and practices this entails, and what you plan to get out of it.

So the creation system has several subsystems, each subsystem (project or category) having connected goals, inputs, outputs, resources, and time commitments. It may be a good idea to consider what all projects you are working on, what your goals are for them, and what you want to commit to them (how many hours per week, for instance). I categorize it as one "main project", several "side projects", and several "creative areas" like playing the keyboard or drawing. I have a weekly minimum hour allocation for side projects and creative stuff, and 4 hours minimum on my main project. For side projects and creative areas, I allow myself to work on whatever I feel like. Sometimes I may have another main project, which receives its own time allocation, but I try to minimize this when possible.
